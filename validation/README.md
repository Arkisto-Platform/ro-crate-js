# Validation tools

RO-Crate-js has a basic RO-Crate validation tool as part of the library. RO-Crate is a very relaxed and permissive specification, so there are only a few requirements that count as validation errors - though the validator will also issue some warnings and some summary information.

## Install

To use validation from the command line.

-  Clone this repository
-  Install: `npm install .`
-  Enable the scripts: `npm link .`
